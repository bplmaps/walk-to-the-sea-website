### The West End
Similar to most of Boston, the West End was once a marsh. The marsh was then dammed and developed to account for population growth. The West End has been an important neighborhood in Boston since the Revolutionary War, especially for African Americans, a large community of Irish, and other working class immigrants. Separated from the North End by Mill Pond, the West End was originally farmland, and then it became home to the transportation hub for the area. Workers from Beacon Hill and the waterfront moved to the West End after it was filled in with land. With the increase of immigrant populations to the area came the rise of tenement buildings and the poor living conditions within. Although it was home to such a diverse population of people, the West End did not have the luxury of Beacon Hill nor the waterfront access of the North End. When it came time to destroy neighborhoods, it is no surprise the West End was first to go. Despite the rich cultural history of the West End, there is little community left within the neighborhood today. So why is that legacy largely missing from the modern streets of the West End today?

### Age of Highways
The 1950s saw extreme growth to the highway system, and cities around the country had to figure out how to make space for the new roads. Boston had a clear plan, tearing down historic working class neighborhoods. Among those lost were the West End, Downtown, and Chinatown. All of these neighborhoods were home to diverse working class communities. 
The Boston Housing Authority built its plan for urban redevelopment around tearing down the ‘slum’ that was the West End. Over 20,000 people were evicted from their homes to create the I-93’s “central artery”. They were given $1 and told they would get the rest of the value at a later date. When that day came all they got was at a fraction of the worth of the homes. Some of Boston’s oldest public squares Adams Square, Scollay Square, and Haymarket Square were completely destroyed to promote commuting between predominantly white suburbs and the city. 
The highway did not only destroy neighborhoods, it cut off the North End, an Italian neighborhood, from the rest of the city. The central artery segregated the neighborhood from the rest of the city by way of an elevated multilane highway. The communities lost during the era of development could never come back. Even as homes were rebuilt, families had been gone for generations. For those in power the 1950s were a period of ‘hatred’ towards the city of Boston. With the wealthy white populations moving into suburbs the focus of development was commuting. The old streets of Boston were seen as dirty and old, detrimental to the makeup of the suburbs. Fred Salvucci, who came up with the idea for the ‘Big Dig’, had this to say about this era in urban planning [“...In the '50s, we just knocked those buildings down. That's a pretty vandalistic way to deal with what I think is a really great city.”](https://www-tc.pbs.org/greatprojects/interviews/salvucci.pdf) Among the historic buildings razed, was the office where The Liberator was published, the paper that served as the heart of the abolition movement in the United States.

### The Big Dig 
Fred Salvucci’s grandmother lost her home when they built the Mass Pike, his brother in law was evicted from his home in the West End to make room for the central artery. When Salvucci grew up he would mastermind the burial of the elevated highway that later became known as the Big Dig. His goal going into urban planning was to build roads and tunnels that did not hurt people or destroy communities. The Big Dig changed a lot for the city of Boston, allowing the North End to rejoin the rest of the city and getting rid of a traffic-filled polluter, but it could not undo the damage previously done. Ian Cross interviewed Chinatown native Randy Tow about the rebuilding of previously destroyed neighborhoods, for his “The Big Dig” podcast with GBH News, [“It was a good gesture. It was something better than not having anything you can never really replace a neighborhood. Nor is anybody asking you to do it. It's impossible.”](https://www.wgbh.org/podcasts/the-big-dig/part-9-hearts-and-minds) The 1950s were an extremely damaging time, a legacy Boston will be faced with forever. The Boston Redevelopment Authority apologized in 2015 for razing the West End. The city has tried to make amends for its actions, but some things are not so easily fixed.

### The Greenway and Today 
With the highway now underground, what used to be the elevated highway is now a park. The city is now reconnected to the North End and its own waterfront. The 17 acre and 1.5 mile long park stretches between those lost neighborhoods. It can never replace the communities displaced in the 50s but it is a lot better than a highway. The Rose Kennedy Greenway is home to community events nearly every night of the week. From beer gardens, artisan markets, food festivals, and exercise classes the park is once again a place for people to come together. 
The West End is now home to TD Garden and Mass General Hospital. It is no longer rows of brick houses but instead high rise buildings, most of which are nonresidential. North Station, the hub of transportation in the city, is only a ten minute walk away from the Greenway. The West End Museum and the Last Tenement, another ten minute walk, are open to ensure the long history of the neighborhood is remembered.
