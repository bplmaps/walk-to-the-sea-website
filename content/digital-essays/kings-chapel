#**Historic Landmarks at Tremont and School Streets**

Welcome to the intersection of Tremont and School Streets, a site that has shaped the cultural and educational landscape of our community. Here, you will find three significant landmarks: King’s Chapel, King’s Chapel Burial Ground, and the Old Latin School. 
Together, these sites illustrate the evolution of faith, education, and civic life in early Boston.

## **King’s Chapel**

King’s Chapel was completed in 1754, replacing the original wooden church established in 1686. It is one of the oldest surviving Anglican churches in Boston and a cornerstone of the city’s religious history. Built as an Anglican church, its architecture is considered one of the finest examples of elegant Georgian style in the U.S., characterized by its symmetrical facade and distinctive bell tower. The chapel's interior features the oldest American pulpit still in continuous use, dating back to 1717,  and the box pew arrangement reflects the worship practices of the 1920s, as it was redesigned at that time. The chapel's bell, forged in England in 1772, cracked in 1814 and was recast by Paul Revere in 1816; it continues to ring today, summoning the faithful to worship. 

During the American Revolution, many of its loyalist members fled to Canada, prompting a brief renaming of the church to “Stone Chapel,” and it remained unused until 1782. Notable members have included several Colonial Royal Governors, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, the poet Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, and the architect Charles Bulfinch, known for designing the Massachusetts State House and the U.S. Capitol. The chapel has also welcomed famous Americans such as George Washington and Abigail Adams. 

The history of King’s Chapel is also intertwined with the legacy of slavery. At least 32% of the funding for its construction came from known enslavers, and at least 68% of the money raised in 1747 was sourced from enslavers and individuals connected to trades linked to slave labor. At least 219 enslaved men, women, and children were directly connected to the chapel or enslaved by its members, though the true number is likely much higher. This complex history highlights the chapel's dual role as both a place of worship and a site deeply connected to the issues of its time, prompting ongoing reflection on its legacy within the community.

## **King’s Chapel Burial Ground**

Adjacent to King’s Chapel, the King’s Chapel Burial Ground is Boston's oldest colonial burial site, established in 1630. This graveyard predates the chapel itself and is not affiliated with any church. It serves as the final resting place for many of the city’s early settlers and prominent figures, including the notable Puritan leader John Winthrop and the influential minister John Cotton. As you stroll through, you’ll encounter a rich array of gravestones featuring skilled carvings and inscriptions in the Puritan style, which poignantly reflect themes of mortality and the afterlife. 

In the 17th and 18th centuries, death was a constant presence in daily life due to widespread illnesses and colonial hardships. This society’s familiarity with death stands in stark contrast to our contemporary views and experience. The headstones, adorned with symbols such as skulls, angels, and hourglasses, reveal how this community saw death as a fact of everyday life. These images not only convey their beliefs and values but also serve as reminders of life’s transient nature. Each grave tells a story, highlighting the contributions of individuals who helped shape Boston’s development. 

Today, 505 headstones and 59 footstones remain from the over one thousand individuals interred here. These preserved markers provide insight into early customs of death and remembrance, inviting visitors to contemplate their own lives. As one of America’s oldest public cemeteries, King’s Chapel Burial Ground embodies the city’s early history and founding ideals, allowing visitors to connect with the lives and legacies of Boston’s founders. This site stands as a testament to the lasting influence of these early residents on the vibrant city we know today.

## **Boston Latin School and the Old City Hall**

Two different buildings have inhabited the parcel of land directly behind King’s Chapel, serving as a cornerstone of Boston’s commitment to education and civic life.  

This area was once home to the Old Latin School, founded in 1635 as the first public school in America. The landmark reflected the community’s dedication to learning, emphasizing classical studies in Latin and Greek to prepare young men for roles in church and government. Among its most notable alumni were Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Adams, and John Hancock. The school was remarkably progressive for its time, offering educational opportunities to children regardless of their social status, thus fostering a knowledgeable citizenry. Over its long history, Boston Latin has produced four Harvard University presidents, four Massachusetts governors, and five signers of the United States Declaration of Independence. Although the physical location of this institution has changed over time, including four relocations on the same street, the legacy of the Old Latin School continues to inspire contemporary educational initiatives. 

In 1865, the site transitioned to the construction of Boston's Old City Hall, an architectural gem characterized by its granite exterior, ornamented columns, mansard roof, and projecting central bay. Designed in the Second Empire style, which is known for its eclectic and modernist influences, this building served as the municipal government center for over a century. It became a hub for public life, where citizens gathered for spirited debates and civic celebrations. Its striking design not only represents architectural beauty but also embodies civic pride and community engagement. Old City Hall, saved from demolition in 1969, was repurposed and now houses vibrant restaurants and office spaces. Together, these historic institutions remind us of Boston’s enduring commitment to education, democracy, and community.
